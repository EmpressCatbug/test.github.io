    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This 3D graphics project began as a final assignment in my CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.
      I created a fully interactive OpenGL scene replicating my desk setup ‚Äî featuring a lavender corner desk, three monitors, and keyboard.
      The scene included WASD movement, perspective switching, textured surfaces, and multiple lighting types.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve visual quality and workflow, I enhanced the project by recreating the scene in Blender. This transition allowed me to incorporate high-resolution textures, advanced lighting, animation, and camera control.
    </p>

    <h2>OpenGL Implementation Highlights</h2>
<p>
  The original version of this scene was developed in OpenGL from scratch using C++, with direct control over shaders, geometry, and user interaction logic. I focused on both technical accuracy and user experience.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>üì¶ Modeled the entire scene using primitive shapes (cubes, cylinders, etc.)</li>
  <li>üñ±Ô∏è Mouse-controlled camera orientation (look up/down/left/right)</li>
  <li>üéÆ Keyboard navigation (W/A/S/D movement) with mouse scroll for movement speed adjustment</li>
  <li>üîÅ Real-time perspective switching with keys (P for perspective, O for orthographic)</li>
  <li>üí° Implemented ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting for realism</li>
  <li>üß© Modular function structure (lighting, input, draw calls) for clean, reusable code</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This interactive control system created an intuitive first-person navigation experience, showcasing both visual composition and responsive camera mechanics.
</p>


    <h2>Visual Comparison</h2>
    <p>Below you can see the transformation from OpenGL to Blender:</p>

    <h3>After: Blender Enhancement</h3>
    <img src="images/cat1after.png" alt="Blender scene after enhancement" />

    <h2>Blender Enhancement Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My goal was to bring realism, creativity, and technical depth to the original concept using Blender.
      I applied real-world materials, animations, and improved visual feedback that would be difficult to achieve in OpenGL alone.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>üé® UV unwrapping, stylized pastel palette, and reflective materials</li>
      <li>üí° Advanced lighting (area lights, HDR reflections, soft shadows)</li>
      <li>üì∏ Dynamic camera movement and layout control</li>
      <li>üïπÔ∏è Interactive elements such as a floating hologram and backlit keyboard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
  One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was developing the camera control system in OpenGL. By handling input buffers and transformation matrices directly, I created a responsive and immersive navigation system ‚Äî allowing users to move freely with the keyboard (WASD), look around with the mouse, and dynamically adjust speed and viewpoint with scroll and key toggles.
</p>
<p>
  This low-level implementation gave me hands-on experience with mathematical foundations of 3D graphics, including view matrices, field of view adjustments, and event polling.
  It also helped reinforce best practices in modular programming, which later made the Blender transition easier.
</p>
<p>
  Iteration, modularity, and user-centered interaction design were core to my process ‚Äî skills that will carry forward in future UI/UX or 3D development roles.
</p>


    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      This project directly aligns with outcomes in software design, innovation, and visual communication.
      I demonstrated advanced modeling, interactive controls, and creative visual design while adapting to new tools. 
      It also reflects my attention to usability, detail, and immersive design ‚Äî all of which will be important in my future UI/UX and graphics work.
