    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This smart thermostat prototype was built for my CS 350 course to explore embedded systems
      using the TI CC3220x LaunchPad. It reads room temperature, controls a heating system, and simulates data transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>Task Scheduler</h2>
    <p>
      The task scheduler ensures efficient handling of temperature sensing, user input, and UART data communication.
      Below is the visual representation of the scheduler:

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      The code includes I2C temperature sensing, GPIO for button inputs, and UART communication.
      It’s modular, documented, and designed for future adaptability.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
    <p>
      A demo video showcases the live functionality: temperature sensing, LED response, and button control.<br>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3>A. What did you do particularly well?</h3>
    <p>I excelled in implementing I2C and UART communication and integrating them into a clean scheduler.</p>

    <h3>B. Where could you improve?</h3>
    <p>The task scheduler can be optimized for performance, and error handling can be improved for robustness.</p>

    <h3>C. What tools and resources did you add to your support network?</h3>
    <p>TI’s Code Composer Studio, draw.io, and TI’s developer forums were instrumental in debugging and design.</p>

    <h3>D. Transferable Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Embedded interface programming (I2C, GPIO, UART), hardware debugging, modular coding — all very applicable to future projects.
    </p>

    <h3>E. Maintainability & Adaptability</h3>
    <p>
      My code structure uses clear naming, modular functions, and in-line documentation, which makes adding new sensors or features easy.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project solidified my understanding of embedded hardware, communication protocols, and system architecture.
      It’s an experience I’ll carry into every future engineering challenge.
