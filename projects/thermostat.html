    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates a smart thermostat system built on the Texas Instruments CC3220x LaunchPad, a microcontroller commonly used in embedded systems. 
      Embedded systems are small, dedicated computers integrated into larger devices — like thermostats, medical devices, or even space probes — where they control specific functions in real-time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The thermostat monitors ambient temperature, allows user input via physical buttons, and controls an LED to simulate a heating element's status. It also mimics data reporting to a server, just like how smart home devices share data with a mobile app or cloud platform.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Several hardware communication protocols were used to bring this system together:
      <strong>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)</strong> was used to communicate with a digital temperature sensor — think of it like a short-range conversation between two components on the same circuit board.
      <strong>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)</strong> enabled data to be sent to a virtual server, similar to how your computer communicates with a USB device.
      <strong>GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)</strong> was used to detect when buttons were pressed by the user.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Together, these elements form a responsive, modular system that could serve as the foundation for more advanced smart home technologies. This project emphasizes clean architecture, hardware integration, and real-time feedback — core principles in embedded software engineering.
    </p>    

    <h2>Task Scheduler</h2>
    <p>
      The task scheduler ensures efficient handling of temperature sensing, user input, and UART data communication.
      Below is the visual representation of the scheduler:

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      The code includes I2C temperature sensing, GPIO for button inputs, and UART communication.
      It’s modular, documented, and designed for future adaptability.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
    <p>
      A demo video showcases the live functionality: temperature sensing, LED response, and button control.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <h3>A. What did you do particularly well?</h3>
    <p>I excelled in implementing I2C and UART communication and integrating them into a clean scheduler.</p>

    <h3>B. Where could you improve?</h3>
    <p>The task scheduler can be optimized for performance, and error handling can be improved for robustness.</p>

    <h3>C. What tools and resources did you add to your support network?</h3>
    <p>TI’s Code Composer Studio, draw.io, and TI’s developer forums were instrumental in debugging and design.</p>

    <h3>D. Transferable Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Embedded interface programming (I2C, GPIO, UART), hardware debugging, modular coding — all very applicable to future projects.
    </p>

    <h3>E. Maintainability & Adaptability</h3>
    <p>
      My code structure uses clear naming, modular functions, and in-line documentation, which makes adding new sensors or features easy.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project solidified my understanding of embedded hardware, communication protocols, and system architecture.
      It’s an experience I’ll carry into every future engineering challenge.
